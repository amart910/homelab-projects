# Wazuh SIEM Deployment on Rocky Linux 9

## 📌 Overview
This project documents the manual installation and configuration of Wazuh (a Security Information and Event Management system) on a Rocky Linux 9 VM running inside Proxmox. This setup supports log collection, real-time threat detection, and agent-based monitoring for Windows and Linux systems in my homelab.

## ⚙️ Tools & Infrastructure
- Proxmox VE (hypervisor)
- Rocky Linux 9 ISO (Minimal DVD)
- Wazuh 4.x (Manager, Filebeat, Elasticsearch, Kibana)
- Windows client for agent deployment
- CLI and Web UI for system administration

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Provisioned VM**
   - Installed Rocky Linux 9 on a Proxmox VM (4 CPU / 4GB RAM / 50GB disk)
   - Configured static IP and hostname

2. **System Preparation**
   - Updated packages: `dnf update -y`
   - Installed essential packages: `curl`, `wget`, `tar`, `unzip`, etc.
   - Set SELinux to permissive

3. **Wazuh Manager Installation**
   - Installed Wazuh GPG key and repo
   - Installed and configured Wazuh Manager
   - Verified service status using `systemctl status wazuh-manager`

4. **Filebeat + Elasticsearch + Kibana**
   - Installed Filebeat from Wazuh repo
   - Configured Filebeat to forward Wazuh logs
   - Added Elasticsearch and Kibana (hosted locally)
   - Tuned memory settings for ELK stack on low-RAM VM

5. **Dashboard Access**
   - Enabled port forwarding/firewall rules
   - Accessed Wazuh Dashboard via browser
   - Verified indices and agent manager connectivity

6. **Windows Agent Installation**
   - Downloaded Wazuh agent on Windows system
   - Input manager IP and authentication key
   - Verified heartbeat on Wazuh dashboard

## 🔐 Security Configurations
- Limited access to Wazuh dashboard to internal LAN
- Disabled root SSH and used key-based login
- Created dedicated admin account on Rocky Linux
- Verified log integrity features in Wazuh

## 🧠 Lessons Learned
- Gained experience with manual SIEM deployment
- Learned ELK stack tuning for performance
- Understood agent registration and log analysis
- Strengthened skills in Linux-based system hardening
