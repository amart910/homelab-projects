# OpenWRT WireGuard VPN Setup

## 📌 Overview
This project covers how I configured a secure VPN using WireGuard on an OpenWRT router (GL.iNet AX1800/Netgear R7800) to enable encrypted remote access to my home lab.

## ⚙️ Tools & Equipment
- GL.iNet Flint (GL-AX1800) & Netgear R7800 (OpenWRT installed)
- OpenWRT 23.x firmware
- WireGuard (installed via Luci or CLI)
- Android + Windows 11 WireGuard apps for client testing
- Public DDNS (optional for remote access)

## 🛠️ Setup Steps
1. Installed and configured OpenWRT on both routers
2. Set up **VLANs** for LAN, IoT, and guest segmentation
3. Installed WireGuard using OpenWRT’s package manager
4. Generated public/private keys on router and client
5. Created WireGuard interface (`wg0`)
   - Assigned static IP range (e.g., `10.14.0.1/24`)
   - Configured listening port (51820/UDP)
6. Set up firewall rules to allow LAN-to-VPN access
   - Allowed forwarding from `wg0` to `lan`
   - Prevented VPN-to-WAN unless explicitly needed
7. Added port forwarding on router for WireGuard
8. Tested connection from external client using cellular network
9. Verified VPN traffic routing using `traceroute` and DNS leak tests

## 🔐 Security Practices
- Used strong private/public key pairs
- Disabled password auth for router access
- Used QR codes for mobile client setup
- Set up logging on OpenWRT to track VPN activity

## 🧠 Lessons Learned
- Learned how to troubleshoot firewall zones in OpenWRT
- Practiced dynamic DNS and port forwarding for remote access
- Understood the importance of VPN peer handshakes and MTU tuning
