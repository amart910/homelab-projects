# Proxmox VE Setup in Homelab

## 📌 Overview
This project outlines how I set up Proxmox VE on a GMKtec Mini PC to create a virtualization platform for my cybersecurity homelab.

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
- Proxmox VE
- Intel N150 Mini PC (16GB RAM, 512GB SSD)
- ISO: Rocky Linux 9, Ubuntu, Debian
- Web interface & shell configuration
- Basic internal networking

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Implementation
1. Downloaded Proxmox VE ISO and flashed using Balena Etcher
2. Booted GMKtec Mini PC via USB
3. Installed Proxmox and accessed Web UI via static IP
4. Created non-root admin user, SSH hardened the host
5. Uploaded ISOs for Rocky Linux, Debian, and Ubuntu
6. Created VMs and assigned resources
7. Set up static IP and local DNS mappings
8. Planned VLAN support and security hardening

## 🔐 Security Practices Implemented
- Disabled root login via SSH
- Added SSH key authentication
- Planned self-signed certificates for browser access
- Created separate Proxmox user with restricted rights

## 🧠 Lessons Learned
- Gained hands-on experience with enterprise-grade hypervisor
- Understood VM storage types (local, LVM)
- Practiced network and user isolation
