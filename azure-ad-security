# Azure Active Directory & Conditional Access Project

## 📌 Overview
This project involved configuring secure user access controls in Azure Active Directory (AAD) using Conditional Access Policies, security groups, and role-based access control (RBAC). Designed to simulate a secure enterprise identity and access management environment.

## ⚙️ Tools & Services
- Azure Active Directory
- Azure Portal
- Microsoft 365
- RBAC
- Conditional Access
- Security Groups

## 🛠️ Key Implementation Steps
1. Created and deleted outdated AAD groups to simulate lifecycle management
2. Designed new security groups aligned to functional roles (e.g., Admins, HR, Developers)
3. Created individual user accounts and assigned appropriate group memberships
4. Applied Conditional Access Policies to enforce:
   - MFA for admin roles
   - Device compliance for sensitive access
   - Location-based restrictions
5. Limited permissions of global admin account; created limited-scope admin accounts for RBAC testing
6. Documented process and permission hierarchy for clarity

## 🔐 Security Highlights
- Enforced MFA and session controls
- Demonstrated separation of duties via RBAC
- Reduced privilege exposure for global admin account
- Planned for Just-In-Time (JIT) access scenarios

## 🧠 Lessons Learned
- Gained hands-on experience with Azure IAM
- Understood Conditional Access as a core Zero Trust control
- Practiced securing cloud infrastructure with granular user controls
